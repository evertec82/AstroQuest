/**
 * Hosts the PS4 emulator core on a Meta Quest: installs its Linux runtime, starts it, feeds it a
 * gamepad paired with the headset as the DualShock 4 the game expects (of a DualSense
 * everything: buttons, sticks, touchpad, motion sensors in; rumble and light bar colour out;
 * of other gamepads what they have) and lets the native side show its frames in the headset.
 * The headset's own controllers play as well; those the native side reads itself, and it
 * decides which of the two the game is played with (PadRouter).
 *
 * Files the user provides live in the app's external folder
 * (/sdcard/Android/data/com.astrobotquest.vrhost/files):
 *   games/SERIAL/eboot.bin ...   the extracted game (or /data/local/tmp/astro/games/SERIAL)
 *   data/shadPS4/                 the emulator's own folder (sys_modules, saves, logs)
 *   vrhost.txt                    optional settings, see readSettings
 * and what the app leaves there for looking at afterwards:
 *   host.log, core.log            this app's log and the emulator's output of the last start
 *   host.prev.log, core.prev.log  the same of the start before

     *                          about a twentieth of the GPU from the game. 3 is the same left

     *   stick_touchpad=0       stop using the right stick as a finger on the touchpad

     *   rumble=0               no vibration
     *   msaa=4                 let the game multisample as it does on the console (1, 2 or 4).
     *                          The default of 1 turns that off: it is by far the most expensive
     *                          thing the headset's GPU is asked to do

     *                          when turning the head, less if the world wobbles
