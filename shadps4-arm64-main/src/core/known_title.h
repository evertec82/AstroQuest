///    frame rate, and reads them wherever time passes. The emulator writes them, frame by
///    frame, with what frames really take: the game then runs by the clock.
///  - Its tracking manager keeps the point it counts head positions from, and the position
///    counted from it, which is what a view that is off shows up in.
///  - It moves the collisions of what moves by a speed worked out with one frame's time step
///    and applied for the next frame's: the same thing on the console, not with a time step
///    that follows the frames. Its physics are changed to step with the time step the bodies
